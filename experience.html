                                  <p>As a Photographer’s Assistant, I was trained in the preparation and return of products through the studio. This required adherence to quality standards and meeting (or exceeding) production rates. Often the role required some innovation with items, as often products were very different yet had to meet consistent imaging requirements. Shoes for example, had to look as if a foot were in them, without using a model or mannequin. This is easy with boots, and very difficult with ballet flats.</p>

                                  <p>As a Photographer, I had to learn how to perform product photography on both table top and automated device setups. I had to research and implement styling and photography techniques of new products. Products I was trained in included footwear, handbags, accessories, cookware, sunglasses, luggage, sports and bedding. The position also required knowledge of both PC and Mac platforms as well as software programs such as Photoshop.</p>

                  <p>As a fourth generation Auctioneer, I began my work in the auction industry as soon as my family could find a task for me. Growing up I had worked with Best Auctions, Pound Auctions and of course Gribbins Auctions. When I first started with Wardlow Auctions, it was after high school and during college, working on the weekends and during the summers (the busiest times for auctions). Eventually I was brought on as regular staff, then full time as an Administrator and eventually a licensed Auctioneer.</p>
