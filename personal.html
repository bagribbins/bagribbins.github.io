          <div id="introduction" class="container-lg shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded">
              <p> I see a job as a means of provision and personal engagement, so there are many things I value in addition to my career. With a Myers-Briggs of ITSJ and being an Enneagram 6, I am very introverted, data driven, systematically minded and thrive with challenges. I have often described myself as a “catalyst” – someone who can step into a situation or team, and work to make it better (my father chooses to use the phrase “instigator”). I value transparency, integrity, hard work and relationships. I strive to prioritize my life as being a Christian, husband, father, family then whatever life may bring.</p>

                              <p class="card-text">One of the greatest foundations of my life is the relationship I have with my family. My wife, Dana, and I have 4 beautiful daughters. Our home is loud and full of energy and we would have it no other way. Dana publishes a blog, <a href="https://lardcupcakes.com/">Lard Cupcakes</a>, where she chronicles the details of our many exploits. We have been through a lot over the past several years, yet one question remains - where <u>did</u> the red hair come from?</p>

                              <p class="card-text">Careers are only a small ingredient in the recipe of life. My wonderful parents taught me to find joy even in the hard times. I have experienced several tragedies, some simple (car accidents, broken bones), others severe (in 2014 I nearly died, spending 25 days in the hospital). One of my most heartwrenching seasons was losing Dana's father (pictured above) after an 18 month battle with cancer. After my own dad, this man is the second most influential man in my life.

                              <h4 class="card-title">The 2020 Gap</h4>
                              <p class="card-text">As 2020 began, I was laid off from my job at Amazon after nearly 10 years. This was a part of a large restructure of the US studios where our location was closed and all positions terminated. As my career endured a hard reboot, I held very conservatively to the guidance from my work with Bob Tiell at <a href="https://jfcslouisville.org/">Jewish Family and Career Services</a> and coaching with <a href="https://jericphillips.com/">J. Eric Phillips </a>. I know what I want, understand what I need and patiently pursue what comes next. While job seeking, I have experienced a lot - delivering my daughter <strong>VERY</strong> unexpectedly at home, enduring a pandemic, volunteering incessantly, studying, learning new skills and even taken some courses. </p>

                              <h4 class="card-title">Volunteer Work</h4>
                              <p class="card-text">Of the many things I try to stay engaged in outside of family and work, some of my most treasured is my involvement with local ministries. My family has attended <a href="https://sojournchurch.com/j-town">Sojourn Church Jtown</a> since 2010. I have been a deacon in the children's ministry for many years, teaching and caring for kids from newborns to 5th grade. For the past couple of years I was also fortunate to become a part of our property maintenance crew, taking care of the 10+ acres of the church property. </p>

                              <h4 class="card-title">Education</h4>
                              <p class="card-text">Learning new things and exploring the unknown has been a passion my entire life. My formal education included graduating Valedictorian with an Advanced Liberal Arts degree in high school and obtaining my BA in Biology from <a href="https://www.transy.edu/">Transylvania University</a> in Lexington, KY. With each new job and role, I have taken opportunities to grow professionally. Prime examples are obtaining my KY Auctioneer License while working auctions, Phase One certification as a Photographer and being certified as a Yellow Belt in Lean/Six-sigma as an Operations Manager at Amazon. Most recently I engaged in the Front End Web development course through <a href="https://codelouisville.org/">Code Louisville</a> to better understand the basics of coding that I was exposed to while doing data analysis at Amazon.</p>

                              <p class="card-text">There are many facets of like that I enjoy, but a few top the list. Origami is something I was introduced to back in 3rd grade and I still find myself exploring new designs from time to time. Discgolf [not 'frisbee golf'] has been one of my favorite passtimes since college and is a regular activity in the summer months. Woodworking has become one of my most recent hobbies, even prompting me to take a course through Louisville's <a href="http://www.tedharlan.com">Ted Harlan Woodworking School</a> where I learned the basics of fine woodworking and made my first polished piece - a coffee table!</p>
