CSS Selectors
    Altough many asthetic adjustments were made using Bootstrap specific classes, targeted CSS selectors were used to modify elements across all pages.
    
JavaScript
    With the primary function of the website being to present data, JavaScipt was used to help manage the information.  The "Experience.html" page utilizes JavaScript in conjunction with the Card and Accordion functionality of Bootstrap to create interactive ways to view detailed information of previous jobs.
